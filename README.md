Imagination is more important than knowledge.

Quantum tunneling is a fascinating phenomenon in quantum mechanics where a particle can pass through a potential energy barrier, even if it doesn't have enough energy to classically overcome it. This is a direct violation of classical physics principles.

How does it work?
In the quantum world, particles exhibit wave-like properties. This wave-like nature allows them to exist in a superposition of states, meaning they can be in multiple states simultaneously. When a particle encounters a barrier, its wave function can extend into the barrier region. While the probability of finding the particle inside the barrier is low, there's a non-zero chance that it might tunnel through and appear on the other side. Â
